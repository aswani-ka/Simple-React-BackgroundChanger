A simple React + Tailwind CSS project that allows users to change the background color dynamically by clicking different color buttons.
This beginner-friendly project demonstrates the use of React state, event handling, and Tailwind styling to create an interactive UI.

## 🚀 Features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

React – Frontend library

Tailwind CSS – Styling framework
